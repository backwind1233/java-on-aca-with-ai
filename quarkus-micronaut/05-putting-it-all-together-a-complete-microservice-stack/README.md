# 05 - Putting it all together, a complete microservice stack

__This guide is part of the [Build, Run and Monitor Intelligent Quarkus and Micronaut Java Apps on Azure Container Apps and Azure OpenAI](../README.md)__

Now that we have made microservices publicly available, we will incorporate a user interface to see them in action. Then, we will use Application Insights to monitor the flow of traffic to and among our services and to track metrics.
