# 06 - Build a Quarkus AI application using Azure OpenAI

__This guide is part of the [Build, Run and Monitor Intelligent Quarkus and Micronaut Java Apps on Azure Container Apps and Azure OpenAI](../README.md)__

In this section, we'll build an AI application that uses [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/) in order to analyze and forecast weather based on historical data.

We'll leverage [Quarkus LangChain4j](https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-langchain4j/dev/index.html) framework to communicate with Azure OpenAI Service APIs in this section.
